India has become the latest country to report cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant as regulators in the United Kingdom have given the green light for the use of a monoclonal therapy, called sotrovimab, to treat those at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.The news came as South Korea’s daily coronavirus case numbers rose to a new high with authorities halting quarantine exemptions for fully vaccinated inbound travellers for two weeks in a bid to fend off the new variant.Meanwhile in the United States, fears over the impact of the new coronavirus strain have risen after it reported its first case in a fully vaccinated person in California. The case returned from South Africa on November 22 and tested positive seven days later.In South Africa, where scientists detected the omicron variant last week, new infections doubled in a day signaling a dramatic surge in the country.The World Health Organization (WHO) said data on how contagious Omicron is should be available “within days”, while the Japanese central bank warned of economic pain as countries tighten containment measures.Here are the latest updates:16 mins ago (11:36 GMT)South African scientists studying the Omicron outbreak believe symptoms are less severe for those reinfected by the new variant or infected after vaccination, a top scientist said.“So we believe, I think very much so, that the reinfections (of the)… disease will be less severe,” said Anne von Gottberg, microbiologist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.“And that’s what we’re trying to prove and to monitor very carefully in South Africa. And the same would hold for those that are vaccinated.”19 mins ago (11:33 GMT)The US has announced a raft of new measures aimed at combating the spread of the coronavirus and the Omicron variant, including requiring all international travellers to test negative for COVID-19 within a day of their departure. The US had previously required vaccinated travellers to test negative within three days their departure.The measures, which President Joe Biden will officially announce in a speech on Thursday, also include an increased push for all US adults to receive booster shots, an extension of mask mandates on public transportation in the country, and a requirement for private health insurance providers to pay for out-home COVID-19 tests.37 mins ago (11:15 GMT)India has confirmed its first two cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the health ministry said.Two men, a 66-year-old and a 46-year-old, had both tested positive for the variant in southern Karnataka state, top health official Luv Agarwal said in a briefing.“All primary contacts and secondary contacts of both the cases have been traced and are being tested,” Agarwal said.1 hour ago (10:43 GMT)1 hour ago (10:37 GMT)Greece has detected its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant, in a Greek citizen on the island of Crete who had returned from South Africa last month, its Health Minister Thanos Plevris told reporters.The man, who has mild syptoms, and all his contacts have been quarantined, the head of Greece’s public health agency EODY Theoklis Zaoutis said.His contacts have tested negative so far and have been closely watched by Greek authorities, he added.1 hour ago (10:22 GMT)The UN health agency is deploying a surge team to South Africa’s Gauteng province, epicentre of the outbreak of the new variant, to help with surveillance and contact tracing.The WHO’s Regional Emergency Director for Africa, Salam Gueye, also said it was providing technical assistance to boost the production and distribution of medical oxygen in Botswana, where Omicron has also been detected.📺LIVE: Tune in for this @WHOAFRO press briefing on the #COVID19 pandemic, the new #Omicron variant and vaccine roll-out in Africa. https://t.co/U8lnZahJYk— WHO African Region (@WHOAFRO) December 2, 20212 hours ago (10:01 GMT)As Germany is trying to halt a dramatic surge in daily cases, it is planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people.Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel and her successor, Olaf Scholz will discuss with leaders of Germany’s 16 states restricting the unvaccinated from access to all but the most essential businesses, such as grocery stores, pharmacies and bakeries.2 hours ago (09:46 GMT)Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a petition by rights groups seeking to repeal temporary measures allowing the domestic intelligence agency to use mobile phone tracing to curb the spread of Omicron.Israeli officials say the phone tracking measure, which is set to expire on Thursday but could be extended, will only be used to locate confirmed or suspected carriers of the new variant.In their petition, four rights groups cited privacy concerns in arguing that the phone tracking by the Shin Bet intelligence agency, used on-and-off since March 2020, violates prior court rulings limiting such surveillance.3 hours ago (09:09 GMT)A “large majority” of 62 passengers on two flights from South Africa who tested positive shortly after arrival in the Netherlands on November 26 had been vaccinated, Dutch authorities said.Under rules in place at the time, passengers were able to board the flight from Johannesburg and Cape Town with either proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test results.3 hours ago (08:49 GMT)The figure skating’s Grand Prix final, one of the key events leading into the Winter Olympics, has been cancelled after Japan closed its borders to non-Japanese visitors, the country’s Skating Federation said.The ISU was informed by the Japan Skating Federation (JSF) that the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final 2021, scheduled to take place from December 9 – 12, 2021 in Osaka (JPN) cannot be held as planned.Read more: https://t.co/jgSoBdxyP2#GPFigure #FigureSkating pic.twitter.com/rk6HR79BY6— ISU Figure Skating (@ISU_Figure) December 2, 2021The Grand Prix final, which was scheduled for the western city of Osaka from December 9-12, is seen as a key step on the road to the Winter Olympics, set for February 4-20 in Beijing.3 hours ago (08:42 GMT)Hong Kong authorities will launch a new “health code” mobile phone application next week that travellers to mainland China would be required to use as the city prepares for a partial reopening of the border with the rest of the country.The app will be similar to one in China, storing a user’s name, address and vaccination status, with a function to scan QR codes to enter restaurants and other venues. It also assigns infection risk to users based largely on their past check-ins.Unlike China’s app, Hong Kong’s will not track a user’s movement, the government said. Only Hong Kong residents who plan to cross the border are required to use the app, which will be available from December 10.4 hours ago (08:16 GMT)A case of Omicron variant has been detected in the French northern region of Ile de France in a person who recently returned from Nigeria, BFM TV reported citing local health authorities.

The decision though was reversed after the government received criticisms that the ban was too strict and tantamount to abandoning its own people.6 hours ago (06:06 GMT)Australia’s tally of people with the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 edged higher on Thursday, prompting state governments to bolster domestic border controls.The country’s most populous state, New South Wales, reported its seventh case of the variant, a person who arrived on November 23 from Doha, Qatar, and noted that the person had not been in southern Africa.“We know this virus is dangerous, it does come out in some different forms,” New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters on Thursday. “Don’t take it lightly.”6 hours ago (05:48 GMT)Authorities in Indonesia have tightened border curbs, extended quarantine and limited movement on strategic toll roads, in a preemptive move to limit the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variantNew domestic travel measures include limiting the volume of traffic on toll roads to reduce people movement, according to the transport minister.“This policy… will be evaluated every now and then as we understand and continue digging more information about this new variant,” senior minister Luhut Pandjaitan said in a statement on Wednesday.7 hours ago (05:21 GMT)FASTEST SURGE TO DATE—The #OmicronVarient is up swinging much faster in both new daily cases and positivity, than all previous waves in South Africa 🇿🇦, according to @nicd_sa data illustrated by @jburnmurdoch.

New Delhi/Roorkee, India – In late October, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi met and invited Pope Francis to India, the country with the second-largest Christian population in Asia.However, in a speech about two weeks earlier, Mohan Bhagwat, head of the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), warned Hindus about religious conversions and alleged “demographic changes” in India’s northeastern states, which have a large Christian population.In his annual speech on October 14 to mark the Hindu festival of Dussehra (also known as Durga Puja), Bhagwat said: “Rising population and demographic imbalance need to be addressed and population policy is to be redesigned. And that policy should be applicable to all irrespective of caste and creed. Illegal immigration in bordering districts and conversions in [the] northeast have changed the demographics further.”The RSS aims to create an ethnic Hindu state out of India. As the head of Sangh Parivar, the umbrella group of Hindu nationalist organisations including the BJP, Bhagwat’s Dussehra speech is considered an agenda-setter for the year.As things later unfolded, Bhagwat’s speech was supplemented with violent attacks on Christians and churches in different parts of India, with mobs making open calls to “behead” them and stop alleged conversions of Hindus.Three days after the speech, Rameshwar Sharma, a BJP legislator in Madhya Pradesh, called for a “Chadar Mukt, Father Mukt Bharat” (an India free of veil-wearing Muslims and Christian priests) while addressing a crowd.On Sunday, in southern Karnataka’s Belur town, alleged members of Bajrang Dal, a far-right Hindu group behind numerous attacks on minorities, disrupted a Christian prayer meeting, accusing the community of conversion.On the same day in New Delhi, a warehouse turned into a church was allegedly vandalised and Sunday mass was disrupted by the same group, whose members were seen shouting “shoot the traitors” in a video accessed by Al Jazeera.Church vandalised in Delhi’s Dwarka allegedly by Bajrang Dal and RSS.

Witnesses told Al Jazeera only about a dozen people were in the church when the attack occurred.Pearl Lance, the daughter of the church’s pastor, was allegedly molested by men, abused and attacked by women, and her phone snatched. Rajat Kumar, a staff member at the church, was hit with iron rods multiple times on his head, resulting in serious injuries.“They dragged me by my neck to the ground floor while raining blows on my face and back. I became unconscious after I was hit with a rod on my head,” Kumar told Al Jazeera, his right eye badly bruised and swollen.Eva Lance, the pastor’s elder daughter, said the family had reported suspicious activity to the police at least four times before the attack. “We received hateful anti-Christian threats by unknown men who followed us before the attack. They accused us of conversion and threatened violence. I had sent an email, visited the police station, and registered a formal complaint on October 2,” she told Al Jazeera.She also alleged a late police response when the attack happened. “We were assured of security by the police but no help came. Even on the day of the attack, we kept calling the police but they only came an hour after the mob had done the damage,” she added.Police even filed a report against the pastor’s family, alleging forced conversions, promoting religious disharmony, criminal conspiracy, and even robbery.According to a report by human rights groups in October, more than 300 attacks on Christians took place in the first nine months of this year, including at least 32 in Karnataka.The report found that of the total 305 incidents of anti-Christian violence, four north Indian states registered as many as 169 of them: 66 in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, 47 in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh, 30 in tribal-dominated Jharkhand, and 30 in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh.At least nine Indian states have planned anti-conversion laws, including Chhattisgarh, which, activists say, has emerged as a “new laboratory” for anti-Christian hatred in India.On October 1, more than 1,000 people gathered in the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh for a “Band Karo Dharmantran” (Stop Religious Conversions) rally – one in a series of events organised in the garb of anti-conversion protests in the central Indian state.Addressing the gathering, Parmatmanand Maharaj, a far-right Hindu leader, urged the people to “arm themselves with axes to teach Christians indulging in conversions a lesson”.“Why do you keep an axe? Behead them,” he said, asking the crowd to follow a “Roko, toko, thoko” (Stop, warn and kill) dictum against the Christians.Among his audience were BJP Parliamentarian Ramvichar Netam, former BJP Parliamentarian Nand Kumar Sai and Chhattisgarh state BJP spokesman Anurag Singh Deo.Sushil Shukla, head of the communication department of the Congress party, which governs the state, accused the BJP of “running out of issues” and “stoking religious hatred”. He said the government will act against the organisers of the Surguja rally after an investigation.T R Koshima, superintendent of police at Surguja, told Al Jazeera they are investigating the matter but no first information report (FIR) – a document prepared by police when they receive information about a cognisable offence – related to the rally has yet been filed.“Though the investigation is ongoing, how much of the speech could be considered instigating since no violence took place thereafter in the district is to be seen,” he said.However, it was not an isolated incident in Chhattisgarh in recent months.This video is from Raipur, Chhattisgarh.Bajrang Dal goons made a forceful entry into a local police and brutally thrashed a member of Christian community, who was arrested over accusations of religious conversions. pic.twitter.com/8j5K1WXfJ4— HindutvaWatch (@HindutvaWatchIn) September 5, 2021On September 5, a Christian pastor was summoned by the police for questioning after complaints from right-wing outfits in the state’s capital of Raipur. Once he reached the police station, he was also allegedly assaulted by the same groups.In the same month, a video clip of a woman – who runs a Hindu right-wing outfit – beating up a pastor in the presence of police constables in the Bhilai district went viral.Jyoti Sharma, the woman accused of attacking the pastor, told Al Jazeera she did not do anything wrong. Though she accepted that an FIR has been filed against her, she called it an “intimidating tactic” and said it will not deter her from “doing ‘kutai’ and ‘thukai'” (attacking and assaulting).In July this year, Sunil Sharma, superintendent of police in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district, issued a circular asking his subordinates to increase surveillance over the “activities” of the Christian missionaries.In Karnataka as well, a BJP-ruled state, attacks on Christians have escalated in recent years, according to William Michaels, president of the United Christian Front.The government recently ordered a “survey” of churches in the state to check “forced conversions” and deployed intelligence officers to gather more information on them.In October, a right-wing mob stormed a makeshift church in Hubballi and sang “bhajans” (Hindu prayer songs) in what they said was a protest against alleged conversions.Several pastors and Christians in Belagavi said they have been given “friendly warnings” by the police against going to the church for prayers until the state assembly session begins in mid-December. In the session, an anti-conversion bill is likely to be proposed by the BJP.Bajrang Dal workers barge into a Christian prayer hall in Hassan district, Karnataka to disrupt prayer and allege religious conversion. ⁦@TheQuint⁩ pic.twitter.com/cljKvnueZ7— Nikhila Henry (@NikhilaHenry) November 29, 2021Dharamlal Kaushik, BJP legislator and leader of the opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly, told Al Jazeera his party “is not against any community but the Congress must stop vote-bank politics” – a reference to minority communities presumably acting as captive voters in India.When asked about increasing attacks and hate speech against Christians, Kaushik instead questioned the Congress on “its silence on the issue of conversion” and blamed the opposition party for the alleged increase in “conversions of Hindus into Christianity”.“In the recent past, the right-wing Hindu nationalist forces have intensified their attacks against the Christians,” a Christian rights activist who documents hate crimes against the community told Al Jazeera, on condition of anonymity.“We can’t unsee the large mobilisations in Chhattisgarh, the attack on the church in Roorkee, the police order in Sukma, the ‘survey’ of churches in Karnataka, and Mohan Bhagwat’s talk on conversion as isolated events. Simply put, it’s Christians after Muslims. Not that these attacks are new but they want them to be more visible public spectacles.”Apoorvanand, who teaches Hindi literature at Delhi University and regularly writes against religious violence in India, said the “normalisation of anti-Christian violence is deeply troubling”.“This doesn’t get reported as much as it should be,” he said.“By choosing a different target (apart from Muslims) for a supposedly different crime, the ‘Hindutva’ (Hindu supremacist) project in India is adding diversity and objectivity to its anti-minority hatred. To the followers, this makes anti-minority hate and vigilante justice look rational and more natural.”
Sydney, Australia – Thousands of miles away from Australia, Disha Zutshi’s heart sank when she heard the news that the country would delay its planned reopening to international students on December 1 due to the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant.For the 18-year-old student from Gurgaon in India, the stress and anxiety of existing in limbo after 20 months of border closures have made her regret ever choosing the country to study in.Zutshi, who plans to fly to Australia in late December, has little confidence the government won’t extend its “temporary pause” on reopening beyond December 15 after Australia confirmed its seventh case of the new variant on Thursday.“We don’t know if they might as well just extend in December,” Zutshi told Al Jazeera. “It’s very demotivating.”Zutshi, who is studying psychology at the University of Melbourne, said she had many friends who had to cancel flights to Australia scheduled for this weekend.“The tickets are very costly, extremely costly,” she said. “The government has absolutely no plans [to help the international students], and the airlines also do not have any way of compensating these students.”Zutshi is among the roughly 130,000 international students who have been waiting desperately to get into Australia since the country shut its borders in March 2020. While some have deferred their studies, others have made do with studying online. After Australia’s decision to delay reopening the border, many students are dealing with anger, frustration and despair all over again.Karen Gan, who is studying online from her home in Nanning city in China while she waits to get into Australia, told Al Jazeera she has lost trust in Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison “because he is a big liar”.“The Australian government made up their mind abruptly,” said Gan, who is studying for a masters in journalism at the University of Melbourne. “According to the news in 2020, they said you could go to Australia sooner or later, but now, delay and delay. I can’t trust them any more. I’m very confused and puzzled about their decision.”“Perhaps staying in China is a better choice,” she added.Australia was the third-most-popular education destination in the world before the pandemic. In 2019, the country’s education sector contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars ($26.7bn) to the economy, supporting about 240,000 jobs.After nearly two years of border closures, the sector’s revenues dropped 28 percent from $34.6 billion ($24.5bn) to $26.7 billion ($18.9bn) in 2020-21, the lowest since the 2015-2016 financial year. In August, the number of enrollments from overseas — most of them from China, India, Nepal and Vietnam — was its lowest since 2015, at just over 550,000.Many universities have announced job cuts and axed courses as revenues have evaporated with the decline in overseas enrollments.Meanwhile, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have already welcomed the return of international students.Chris Ziguras, a global studies professor at RMIT University in Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that while the Australian government’s stance was led by public health concerns, it has failed to communicate a clear path to reopening, leaving the sector “blindsided and scrambling to catch up”.“I guess the government is reluctant to make any commitments because they don’t know what’s going to happen,” Ziguras said. “And then the government wants to leave its options open until the last possible minute and then decide.”Students have also been discouraged by the Australian government’s attitude towards them.Oscar Ong, national president of the Council of International Students Australia, told Al Jazeera that international students have been treated as “cash cows” due to the revenue they bring to Australia’s universities and economy.“We hope that the Australian government would be able to treat international students just like residents,” Ong said. “International students are not just coming here to study, not just get into work — a lot of them want to come here to live as well.”Universities Australia Chief Executive Officer Catriona Jackson said universities would continue working closely with the Australian government to bring international students back on campus.“It’s important to acknowledge the incredible resilience of those who have waited patiently for up to two years to resume their studies on campus,” Jackson said.In the meantime, international students such as Toolsika Rawoah can do little but wait.Rawoah, who has been studying online from Mauritius, said she would hold off on booking tickets to Australia and see if more restrictions are on the way.“It does negatively impact on the hopes of all students who were excited to resume their lives in Australia and personally to me too, as there are too many uncertainties,” said Rawoah, who is studying criminal justice and psychology at Victoria University in Melbourne.Rawoah said existing in a state of limbo for so long has severely affected both her studies and mental health.“There is no stability in maintaining a healthy working life with so many uncertainties about whether students will eventually be able to come back, or if they have to wait a long time for seats on planes to be available, ” she said.
The United Kingdom has approved the use of a drug to treat people at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms, which the manufacturers say appears to be effective against the new Omicron variant.The antibody treatment, sotrovimab, “was found to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who are at an increased risk of developing severe disease”, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said in a statement on Thursday.A single dose of the drug was found to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79 percent in high-risk adults with symptomatic COVID-19, according to the regulator.Following its review, the MHRA recommended sotrovimab, also known under the brand name Xevudy, be used as soon as possible and within five days of the onset of symptoms.June Raine, the MHRA’s chief executive, welcomed its addition to the UK’s arsenal for battling the coronavirus pandemic as “yet another therapeutic that has been shown to be effective at protecting those most vulnerable to COVID-19”.Last month, the UK became the first country to approve molnupiravir, a potentially game-changing COVID-19 antiviral pill jointly developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.Sotrovimab was developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a UK-based company, and the US-headquartered Vir Biotechnology.It is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that attaches to the spike protein of the coronavirus, reducing its ability to enter the body’s cells.GSK said on Thursday that lab analysis showed the drug is effective against viruses that were bio-engineered to carry a number of hallmark mutations of the Omicron variant, which is more heavily mutated than previous strains of the coronavirus.Preclinical data showed that the drug “retains activity against key mutations of the new Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant,” the pharmaceutical giant said in a statement.Tests are ongoing to confirm the results against all of the Omicron mutations with an update expected by year-end, it added.GSK said sotrovimab had also demonstrated “ongoing activity” against all other tested variants of concern and interest identified by the World Health Organization, including the highly transmissible Delta strain which has fuelled a surge in cases in many parts of Europe, the current epicentre of the pandemic, in recent months.Treatments to tackle the global health crisis, which has killed more than five million people worldwide, have so far focused mainly on vaccines.
Iran’s top diplomat says an agreement to revive his country’s nuclear deal with world powers was “within reach” but that this depended on the goodwill of the West.Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Twitter on Thursday that negotiations in the Austrian capital, Vienna, were “proceeding with seriousness” and that the removal of sanctions was a “fundamental priority”.“Good deal within reach if the West shows good will. We seek rational, sober and result-oriented dialogue,” said Amir-Abdollahian.The talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers – Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States – resumed on Monday after Iran paused them in June following the election of President Ebrahim Raisi.The US, which unilaterally pulled out of the deal in 2018, is only participating in the talks indirectly at Iran’s insistence.#ViennaTalks proceeding with seriousness and sanctions removal as fundamental priority. Expert talks are continuing too.In daily contact with top negotiator @Bagheri_Kani.Good deal within reach if the West shows good will. We seek rational, sober & result-oriented dialogue.— H.Amirabdollahian امیرعبداللهیان (@Amirabdolahian) December 1, 2021The goal of the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is to make it practically impossible for Iran to build an atomic bomb while allowing it to pursue a civilian nuclear programme.Under the pact, Tehran limited its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.Separately on Thursday, Iran provided the European powers involved in the deal with two drafts on sanctions removal and nuclear commitments, Iran’s top nuclear negotiator said.“We have delivered two proposed drafts to them … Of course they need to check the texts that we have provided to them. If they are ready to continue the talks, we are in Vienna to continue the talks,” Ali Bagheri Kani told reporters.A European diplomat confirmed draft documents had been handed over.Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Vienna, said the proposals seemed to indicate “solid” progress at the talks.“We understand from an Iranian diplomatic source that one of these proposals will be about lifting the sanctions, and the other will be on Iran rolling back the measures it took after the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal,” he said.“The elements of these proposals are going to be built upon what was agreed on in the past six rounds of talks between Iran and the world powers.“However, new points were added, ones that were disregarded in the past talks and Iran believes they are crucial in order to reach an agreement.”Meanwhile, Israel called on world powers to halt the nuclear negotiations immediately, citing a UN watchdog’s announcement that Tehran has started producing enriched uranium with more advanced centrifuges.“Iran is carrying out nuclear blackmail as a negotiating tactic, and this should be answered by the immediate halt to negotiations and the implementation of tough steps by the world powers,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s office quoted him as saying in a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday.The deal has come under increasing strain since then-President Donald Trump pulled the US out and reimposed harsh sanctions, prompting Tehran to breach nuclear limits in the pact.In turn, Iran, which denies it wants to acquire a nuclear arsenal, has gradually abandoned its commitments since 2019.
